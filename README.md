# vulnerable-k8s-operator
Sometimes, it's helpful to practice identifying security vulnerabilities in a running k8s cluster that's not production. So this is a very simple k8s operator that picks a random vulnerability from the [OWASP Kubernetes Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-kubernetes-top-ten/) and configures a k3s cluster with that misconfiguration.

> NB: Becuase K05 from the list, Indequate Logging and Monitoring, is a bit tricky/brittle to detect, we've skipped it here, but it's definitely part of a wider security audit that should be done in a production system.

The first thing to do is run some scanners to see what you can pick up (or you can eyeball the cluster/spec/etc, but the scanners are probably what you'll be using in production automation).

- [kubescape](https://kubescape.io/docs/install-cli/) (for K01, K03, K04, K07, K08)
- kubeaudit (for K01, K06, K08)
- [kube-bench](https://aquasecurity.github.io/kube-bench/v0.6.7/installation/) (for K09)
- [trivy](https://trivy.dev/dev/getting-started/installation/) (for K02, once you've identified an insecure image)

...I don't currently have a good automated tool for K10 (Outdated and Vulnerable Components, but I'm sure we can find something)

## Description
For V1, we're just going to use a specific misconfiguration for each of the top ten. For V2, we'll randomize the particular type of misconfiguration within each of the categories. For example, for K02, we can select from the following:
- untrusted image registries
- container images with CRITICAL CVEs
- configuration poisoning to use an http protocol instead of https
- addition of a malicious init container

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/vulnerable-k8s-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/vulnerable-k8s-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/vulnerable-k8s-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/vulnerable-k8s-operator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
operator-sdk edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.
